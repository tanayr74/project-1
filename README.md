# Caeser Cipher Encryption Tool
Encryption is the process of scrambling readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable secret code (ciphertext) to prevent unauthorized access. The Caesar cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext shifts by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. This method effectively conceals messages from casual observation, making it a useful encryption algorithm.

The goal of this project is to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application that:

• Demonstrates the Caesar Cipher mechanism 
• Allows seamless encryption and decryption by specifying shift
• Clears and copies text with a single click
• Provides access for voice to text conversion
• Ability to import & export to files

This tool offers an intuitive and beginner-friendly introduction to classical cryptography.
